To display Markdown-formatted text generated through a Python `generator` within Tkinter's Text widget (or any other type of Widget), you can do something like this. Here, I am assuming that your generator yields strings and not lists or tuples as the requirement suggests - hence my use of for loop to iterate over words in each line:

```python
from tkinter import Tk, Text  # Importing necessary modules from Python's standard library  
import markdown_to_html    # Assuming your Markdown converter is called 'markdown_to_html'. You may need to adjust this part. It might require you providing the function for converting a given text into HTML or whatever format suits best in yours case — like using some html parsing library
import tkinter as tk    # Importing necessary modules from Python's standard library  
from typing import Any, Iterable, Union
    
def create_markdown(input: str) -> list[str]: return [line + '\n' for line in markdown_to_html.convert(input)]  # This is just an example; you would replace this with your actual Markdown converter function  
   
# Create the main Tk window as a tk object and give it title    
root = tkinter.Tk()       
     
textwidget1=tk.Text(master= root) # create text widget on master 
      
def generate_and_display():         while True:              try:                      line =  next("your-generator")   for word in [line]:                       if not isinstance (word, str):                        raise StopIteration                  else :                   markdown = '\n'.join(create_markdown('This is the header'))                    textwidget1.insert ('end', 'Markdown:\n'+md)
```  # This part should be replaced with your actual generator function   and how you want to display it in Tkinter Text widget    I hope this helps! Please provide more details or context about what exactly needs a modification, so that we can give an accurate answer. If `markdown_to_html` is not available for whatever reason (perhaps because the Markdown module isn't installed), then you will need to install it first using pip: 
```python
pip3 install markdown-to-html    # Python version may vary, use your own python executable path if necessary  
```      If `markdown_to_html` function is not a generator but returns list of strings instead (for example like in the above code), then you can just join them into one string with newlines. Same applies for other markup languages supported by Python's Markdown module, adapt accordingly if necessary:
```python
markdown = '\n'.join(create_markdown('This is a paragraph.'))    # '...and so on until your generator returns its next line or an exception occurs!'   This code should be replaced with the actual function call. Also note that `'end'` may not work in all versions of Tkinter, you might have to use something like:
```python
textwidget1.insert(tk.END)  # '...if your Markdown strings are long and could cause an overflow error.'   This code should be replaced with the actual method call for adding text into a Text widget in Python's Tkinter GUI library if it doesn’t work as intended already
```     Please provide more details about what you need so I can give better assistance.  Also note that this example is using your provided function `create_markdown` which assumes each line of the Markdown text will be a separate paragraph and wraps them in HTML tags for styling purposes (it might not work as expected if it’s used to parse single-line strings).
