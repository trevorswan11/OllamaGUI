The sky appears blue to our eyes due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. He first explained this effect in the late 19th century.

Here's what happens:

1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).
2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.
3. **Blue light is scattered**: As a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, giving it a blue appearance.
4. **Eye sees blue sky**: When we look up at the sky, our eyes see the scattered blue light, which appears as a blue color.

Other factors can influence the apparent color of the sky:

* **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's position in the sky causes shorter wavelengths to be scattered away from our line of sight. This is why the sky often appears more red or orange during these times.
* **Air pollution**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter light in different ways, changing the apparent color of the sky.
* **Clouds and atmospheric conditions**: Clouds and other atmospheric factors can also affect the way we see the sky.

So, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter (blue) wavelengths being scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths.
